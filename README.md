=========

This is a project that you can download and learn from. There is no executable code in this project. It only demonstrates, how to set up maven site documentation using markdown, Twitter Bootstrap skin and some velocity macros that make it possible to include some part of the code into the documentation verbatim.

If you remember the doxia snippet macro and miss it, then this is your project. Clone it and use it.
